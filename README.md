# adult_census_income

This is the R project files for Harvard Edx Chose Your Own Project. I have used the kaggle dataset 'adult census income' for my project.
For running the project, it is assumed that the input file is available in \data directory of the current working directory. 
I have provided the input file that I downloaded from kaggle in the \data directory. 
Please copy that to your working directory if you want to run the R script or markdown.

Thanks for your time!
